# context-aware-semantic-search# Context-Aware Semantic Search Platform

This project aims to build a LangChain-powered application for semantic search over user-uploaded knowledge bases, featuring conversational memory, NLP enhancements, and an interactive UI.

## Project Goal
- Accept multiple user-uploaded documents (PDFs, text, etc.).
- Enable semantic search and natural follow-up questions with conversational memory.
- Return top 3 contextually relevant results with page references.
- Include advanced NLP (e.g., NER or synonym expansion).
- Offer an evaluation UI and embedding space visualization.
-Provide a question answering module using top-ranked document chunks.

## Tech Stack 
- LangChain
- Python
- Streamlit (for UI)
- FAISS/Chroma (for vector store)
- OpenAI/HuggingFace models (for embeddings & LLMs)
- spaCy/NLTK (for NLP enrichment)
- UMAP/t-SNE + Plotly (for visualization)

## Setup Instructions
